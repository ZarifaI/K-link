K-Link: My Connection App for Kalamazoo College

K-Link is a social networking app specifically designed and created for Kalamazoo College, where I am currently a student. The app serves as a digital hub for students to connect, collaborate, and build meaningful relationships within our college community. Understanding the challenges that students often face in finding study partners, making friends, and staying engaged on campus, K-Link was developed to bridge these gaps and foster a stronger, more connected student body.

Key Features:
Study Buddy Finder: K-Linkâ€™s core feature is the Study Buddy Finder, which allows students to match with peers who share similar academic interests, courses, or study habits. Whether you're preparing for finals or looking for a group project partner, K-Link makes it easy to find someone compatible to collaborate with.

Personalized Profiles: Every user has a personalized profile where they can showcase their interests, academic focus, and extracurricular activities. This helps others get to know you better and makes it easier to connect with like-minded peers.

Real-Time Messaging: Stay connected with your K-College friends through K-Link's real-time messaging feature. Whether you need to chat about a group project or just want to catch up with a classmate, the app keeps communication seamless and accessible.
